# CG DevX <WL_NAME> Repository

Welcome to your new `<WL_NAME>` repository.

The `<WL_NAME>` repository has the following templates pre-build for you

- `.argo`: ArgoWorkflow pipelines
- `.github`:  GitHub Actions
- `wl-service` Root folder for your first service that contains a sample `Dockerfile`

To simplify CI/CD, when using monorepo, it's recommended to use folder for each service and have one `Dockerfile` per
service
